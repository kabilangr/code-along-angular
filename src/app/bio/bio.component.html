    <p>
      I am an engineering graduate on Electrical and electronic Engineering
      with little knowledge of coding in java. This is how i use to be. Ones
      I started learning programming. It was like a "continue;" statement
      where I started to goto next step. Interestingly I got intrest in
      learning programming language, new software and technologies.

      After Learning HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT I made the Blog which was fun.
      ProGrad make us enjoy coding. After joining FULL STACK DEVELOPER
      program in FACE, now i have a clear view of JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, HTML and
      CSS.
